## Introduction

**Codebase Underway** - A comprehensive development platform showcasing modern web technologies and component libraries. Built with Next.js, TypeScript, and cutting-edge tools, this repository serves as both a functional application and a reference implementation for developers.

We believe in **open development** where every component, pattern, and solution is accessible, documented, and ready to be adapted for your projects. This isn't just a codebase — it's a foundation for building scalable, maintainable applications.

The Repository of **Components.** From atomic UI elements to complex data tables, from authentication systems to internationalization patterns — we're building the essential blocks that modern applications need. Every component is crafted with attention to detail, accessibility, and developer experience.

Join us as we **build** in public. This codebase represents real-world patterns, tested solutions, and battle-tested architectures. Whether you're learning modern web development or building your next application, you'll find valuable insights and reusable components here.

## Development Principles

### Code Quality
Every component and pattern follows strict quality standards with TypeScript for type safety, ESLint for code consistency, and Prettier for formatting. We prioritize maintainable, readable code that scales.

### Accessibility
Built with accessibility in mind using Radix UI primitives and following WCAG guidelines. Every component is keyboard navigable, screen reader compatible, and inclusive by design.

### Performance
Optimized for speed with Next.js 15, server components, and modern React patterns. We leverage static generation, edge functions, and efficient bundling for optimal user experience.

### Developer Experience
Comprehensive documentation, clear examples, and intuitive APIs. We focus on making it easy for developers to understand, use, and extend our components and patterns.
