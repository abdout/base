# Typography

Typography styles and components for your app.

## Introduction

The `typography.tsx` component provides a set of pre-styled text elements that you can use throughout your app. All typography components use semantic HTML elements and are styled with Tailwind CSS.

## Usage

```tsx
import { Typography } from "@/components/ui/typography"

export default function Example() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Typography.H1>The Joke Tax Chronicles</Typography.H1>
      <Typography.P>
        Once upon a time, in a far-off land, there was a very lazy king who
        spent all day lounging on his throne. One day, his advisors came to him
        with a problem: the kingdom was running out of money.
      </Typography.P>
      <Typography.H2>The King's Plan</Typography.H2>
      <Typography.P>
        The king thought long and hard, and finally came up with{" "}
        <Typography.Link href="#">a brilliant plan</Typography.Link>: he would tax the jokes in the
        kingdom.
      </Typography.P>
      <Typography.Blockquote>
        "After all," he said, "everyone enjoys a good joke, so it's only fair
        that they should pay for the privilege."
      </Typography.Blockquote>
      <Typography.H3>The Joke Tax</Typography.H3>
      <Typography.P>
        The king's subjects were not amused. They grumbled and complained, but
        the king was firm:
      </Typography.P>
      <Typography.List>
        <li>1st level of puns: 5 gold coins</li>
        <li>2nd level of jokes: 10 gold coins</li>
        <li>3rd level of one-liners : 20 gold coins</li>
      </Typography.List>
      <Typography.P>
        As a result, people stopped telling jokes, and the kingdom became a very
        boring place. But at least the king was able to balance his budget.
      </Typography.P>
    </div>
  )
}
```
