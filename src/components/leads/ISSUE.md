# Leads Module - Issues & Enhancement Roadmap

## 🔴 Critical Issues

### 1. Internationalization Gaps
- **Issue**: Multiple components have hardcoded strings
- **Affected Files**:
  - `leads-table.tsx` (30+ hardcoded strings)
  - `lead-detail-sheet.tsx` (20+ hardcoded strings)
  - `mobile-lead-card.tsx` (10+ hardcoded strings)
- **Priority**: HIGH
- **Solution**: Replace all hardcoded strings with dictionary references

### 2. Modal System Migration
- **Issue**: Currently using sheets instead of centralized modal system
- **Current**: Uses Sheet components for create/edit
- **Target**: Migrate to `@/components/atom/modal/` system
- **Priority**: HIGH
