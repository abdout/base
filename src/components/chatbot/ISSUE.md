# Chatbot Component - Known Issues & Future Improvements

## Current Status
âœ… Component is fully functional and ready for integration

## Known Issues
1. **API Key Required**: OpenAI API key must be configured in environment variables
2. **Rate Limiting**: No rate limiting implemented for API calls (recommended for production)
3. **Message Persistence**: Chat history is not persisted across page refreshes

## Future Improvements

### High Priority
- [ ] Add message persistence using localStorage or database
- [ ] Implement rate limiting for API calls
- [ ] Add typing indicators for better UX
- [ ] Support for file uploads and attachments
- [ ] Add conversation export functionality (PDF, TXT)

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Support for multiple AI providers (Anthropic, Google, etc.)
- [ ] Add user authentication and chat history per user
- [ ] Implement chat analytics and metrics
- [ ] Add support for suggested responses/quick replies
- [ ] Voice input/output capabilities
- [ ] Custom themes and styling options

### Low Priority
- [ ] Add emoji picker for messages
- [ ] Support for rich text formatting
- [ ] Integration with CRM systems
- [ ] Webhook support for external integrations
- [ ] Multi-agent support for specialized responses

## Performance Considerations
- Bundle size: ~15KB gzipped (excluding AI SDK)
- Initial load time: <100ms
- Message response time: Depends on AI provider

## Browser Compatibility
- Tested on Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+
- Mobile browsers fully supported
- RTL languages (Arabic) fully supported

## Security Notes
- API key should never be exposed to client
- Implement CORS properly for production
- Add input sanitization for user messages
- Consider implementing content moderation

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Test on mobile devices
- [ ] Test RTL layout with Arabic
- [ ] Test with slow network connections
- [ ] Test with long conversations (100+ messages)
- [ ] Test error handling scenarios
- [ ] Test accessibility with screen readers

## Migration Notes
For projects migrating from other chat solutions:
1. Update API endpoint configuration
2. Map existing translation keys
3. Update styling to match brand
4. Test thoroughly in staging environment
