# MCP-Powered Workflows for Databayt

## ðŸš€ Automated Development Workflows

### 1. Feature Implementation Pipeline

```markdown
# Complete feature from issue to production

Step 1: Gather Requirements
> @claude Check Linear issue ENG-456 and the linked Notion specs.
  Also review the Figma designs referenced in the issue.

Step 2: Implementation with Subagents
> @claude Based on the requirements, use the architecture-advisor to plan
  the file structure. Then implement using shadcn-ui-specialist for UI
  and typescript-pro for type safety. Ensure all components follow our
  atomic design pattern.

Step 3: Database Updates
> @claude Check our postgres schema and update Prisma models as needed
  for this feature. Generate and run migrations safely.

Step 4: Testing & Validation
> @claude Use unit-test-writer to create tests for the new feature.
  Deploy to Vercel preview and check Sentry for any errors.

Step 5: Documentation & Deployment
> @claude Update the relevant MDX docs, create a Linear comment with
  implementation details, and prepare for production deployment.
```

### 2. Bug Investigation & Resolution

```markdown
# Systematic bug fixing with MCP

Step 1: Error Discovery
> @claude Check Sentry for the TypeError in production. Get the full
  stack trace and affected users count.

Step 2: Root Cause Analysis
> @claude Use bug-detective to analyze the error. Check our postgres
  logs at the time of the error. Look for related Linear issues.

Step 3: Fix Implementation
> @claude Implement the fix following our TypeScript strict mode.
  Add defensive coding and proper error boundaries.

Step 4: Verification
> @claude Deploy fix to Vercel preview, monitor Sentry for recurrence,
  and update the Linear issue with resolution details.
```
